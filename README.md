# NomCup

![NomCup the mascot](nomcup.png)

This is a Rust library that parses `PKGBUILD` files used by pacman the package manager.

There are three main sources of inspiration for name:
* [namcap](https://projects.archlinux.org/namcap.git/) — a Pacman package analyzer
* [nOm](https://github.com/Geal/nom) — an awesome Rust library to create parsers
* [rUst](https://www.rust-lang.org) — language this library is written in

Now it's a hungry cup, waiting to eat all the tokens from your `PKGBUILD`.
